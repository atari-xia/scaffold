/**
 * The purpose of this object is to provide a set of common functionality that can be shared across
 * page objects in an implementing project.
 * <p>
 * A common use case for all pages is a form of verification that the page is correct when navigated
 * to. For now, the inclusion of {@link #verifyIsOnPage(BaseWebElement...)} will be used. As we
 * continue development, we can continue to add functionality here.
 * <p>
 * Note: We should also be very protective about page objects *not* having access to the web driver.
 * The page object, by design, should be agnostic to any relationship with the web driver and only
 * have the knowledge of our strongly typed elements. With access to the web driver, it will be very
 * easy to get carried away with back doors that could break threading for testing.

  /**
   * A method that is used to verify a number of elements are displayed on the page when navigating
   * to it. In addition, it will check to ensure the DOM is in a ready and loaded state prior to
   * proceeding. This will help alleviate issues with websites where it takes additional time to
   * load the page due to extraneous db calls or slow loading JS.
   * <p>
   * It's best to use this method in the constructor of the page object as it will be invoked at the
   * time the page is instantiated. For example:
   *
   * <pre>{@code
   *  &#64;Getter
   *  public class LoginPage() {
   *      private final InputWebElement emailInput = new InputWebElement("#email");
   *      private final InputWebElement passwordInput = new InputWebElement("#password");
   *
   *      public LoginPage() {
   *             verifyIsOnPage(getEmailInput, getPasswordInput);
   *      }
   *  }
   * }
   * </pre>
   * <p>
   * The elements passed in to this method will be checked by selenium to see if they are displayed.
   * Make sure to pass in elements that are unique to the page that won't show up on other pages.
   * For example, a login page will have an email and password input and would pass in those
   * elements as parameters. Don't use elements from headers or a logo that might appear across
   * every page on your website.
   *
   * @param element the element(s) that will be checked if displayed
   * @return the {@link Boolean} value to determine if the page is correctly loaded
